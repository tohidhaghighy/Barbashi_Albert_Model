1 - With  the  help  of  a  computer,  generate  a  network  with  N  =  104  nodes  using the Barabási-Albert model with m = 4. Use as initial condition a fully connected network with m = 4 nodes.

2 - Consider a variation of the Barabási-Albert model, where at each time step a new node arrives and connects with a directed link to a node chosen with probability

3 - THE BARABÁSI-ALBERT MODELHOMEWORK5.3. Copying Model :Use the rate equation approach to show that the directed copying mod-el leads to a scale-free network with incoming degree exponent .

4 -  Growth Without Preferential Attachment : Derive the degree distribution (5.18) of Model A, when a network grows by  new  nodes  connecting  randomly  to  m  previously  existing  nodes.  With  the  help  of  a  computer,  generate  a  network  of  104  nodes  using  Model  A.  Measure  the  degree  distribution  and  check  that  it  is  consistent  with  the  prediction
