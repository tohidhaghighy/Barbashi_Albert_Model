# BA Model
The Barabási–Albert (BA) model is an algorithm for generating random scale-free networks using a preferential attachment mechanism. Several natural and human-made systems, including the Internet, the world wide web, citation networks, and some social networks are thought to be approximately scale-free and certainly contain few nodes (called hubs) with unusually high degree as compared to the other nodes of the network. The BA model tries to explain the existence of such nodes in real networks. The algorithm is named for its inventors Albert-László Barabási and Réka Albert and is a special case of an earlier and more general model called Price's model

- Answer Barbashi Session 5

1 - With  the  help  of  a  computer,  generate  a  network  with  N  =  104  nodes  using the Barabási-Albert model with m = 4. Use as initial condition a fully connected network with m = 4 nodes.

2 - Consider a variation of the Barabási-Albert model, where at each time step a new node arrives and connects with a directed link to a node chosen with probability

3 - THE BARABÁSI-ALBERT MODELHOMEWORK5.3. Copying Model :Use the rate equation approach to show that the directed copying mod-el leads to a scale-free network with incoming degree exponent .

4 -  Growth Without Preferential Attachment : Derive the degree distribution (5.18) of Model A, when a network grows by  new  nodes  connecting  randomly  to  m  previously  existing  nodes.  With  the  help  of  a  computer,  generate  a  network  of  104  nodes  using  Model  A.  Measure  the  degree  distribution  and  check  that  it  is  consistent  with  the  prediction
